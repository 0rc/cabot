{"name":"Cabot","tagline":"Self-hosted, easily-deployable infrastructure monitoring and alerts service","body":"Cabot\r\n=====\r\n\r\nCabot is a free, open-source, self-hosted infrastructure monitoring platform that provides some of the best features of [PagerDuty](http://www.pagerduty.com), [Server Density](http://www.serverdensity.com), [Pingdom](http://www.pingdom.com) and [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org) without their cost and complexity. (Nagios, I'm mainly looking at you.)\r\n\r\nIt provides a web interface that allows you to monitor services (e.g. \"Stage Redis server\", \"Production ElasticSearch cluster\") and send telephone, sms or hipchat/email alerts to your on-duty team if those services start misbehaving or go down - all without writing a line of code. Best of all, you can use data that you're already pushing to Graphite/statsd to generate alerts, rather than implementing and maintaining a whole new system of data collectors.\r\n\r\nYou can alert based on:\r\n\r\n*   Metrics from [Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web)\r\n*   Status code and response content of web endpoints\r\n*   [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org) build statuses","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
